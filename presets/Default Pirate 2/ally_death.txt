Arrr, ye'll be swimming with the fishes, |CN|!
Blimey! They got ye, |CN|!
Ye fought like a landlubber, |CN|.
Looks like ye'll be polishing the deck, |CN|!
Aye, get back to the ship, we'll take it from here!
You went down faster than a sinking ship!
Shiver me timbers, that was a rough one, |CN|!
Aye aye, cap'n, yer spirit lives on!
We’ll avenge ye, don’t ye worry!
Ye should've walked the plank instead!
Ye'll be back in no time, |CN|!
Arrr, get yer sea legs back, |CN|!
Ye went down like a storm-tossed galleon!
Looks like they caught ye napping, |CN|!
Blimey, they got ye good!
Arrr, ye took one for the team, |CN|!
Back to the ship with ye!
The sea be cruel today, |CN|.
Blimey, what a mess ye made!
Ye got taken down quicker than a squall!
Aye, we'll get 'em next time!
Ye'll be avenged, no doubt about it!
Arrr, ye'll live to fight another day!
They caught ye off guard, matey!
Looks like ye need more rum in yer system!
We’ll get ’em back for ye, |CN|!
That be a hard loss, matey!
Aye, yer sacrifice won't be forgotten!
Arrr, tough break, |CN|!
Ye fought valiantly, |CN|!
Ye got sent to the depths!
The sea claimed another soul!
Arrr, tough luck, |CN|!
Back to the ship, ye scallywag!
Aye, they got the better of ye this time!
Blimey, they got ye good!
Ye'll be swabbing the deck for that!
Arrr, tough break, |CN|!
The sea was not in yer favor, |CN|.
Ye went down like a rusty anchor!
Aye, we’ll make ’em pay for that!
Back to the ship, ye landlubber!
The sea's cruel today, |CN|.
Arrr, ye fought well, but lost!
Aye, get back to the ship, we'll take it from here!
Ye went down faster than a cannonball!
Blimey, they sent ye to the depths!
