Wow, even a broken clock is right twice a day, |CN?|.
|CN?|, you finally did something useful.
Miracles do happen, nice kill |CN?|.
Guess even you get lucky sometimes, |CN?|.
I'm shocked you didn't mess that up, |CN?|.
|CN?|, I'm genuinely surprised.
Congrats, you managed to press R, |CN?|.
One kill doesn’t make you good, |CN?|.
|CN?|, even a blind squirrel finds a nut.
Don't get cocky, |CN?|.
Even you couldn't mess that one up, |CN?|.
About time you did something, |CN?|.
|CN?|, still not impressed.
|CN?|, even a broken champ gets a kill.
Barely scraping by, huh, |CN?|?
|CN?|, you finally clicked the right buttons.
That was painful to watch, |CN?|.
Nice, but don't think it makes you good, |CN?|.
|CN?|, even you can’t mess up every time.
Wow, you actually did it, |CN?|.
Congrats on finally doing something, |CN?|.
|CN?|, even a fluke is still a kill.
You're still bad, but nice job, |CN?|.
You actually contributed, |CN?|.
Don't get too proud, |CN?|.
Even you can't fail all the time, |CN?|.
|CN?|, a rare moment of competence.
You got one, big deal, |CN?|.
Surprised you didn’t feed, |CN?|.
Even a goldfish can kill sometimes, |CN?|.
|CN?|, that was more luck than skill.
Don't expect applause, |CN?|.
That’s your one good play, |CN?|.
Even the worst get a kill, |CN?|.
Bare minimum, |CN?|.
Wow, |CN?|, a miracle.
|CN?|, that was a pity kill.
You got one, now back to feeding, |CN?|.
Even you can’t fail always, |CN?|.
Congrats, you pressed some buttons, |CN?|.
|CN?|, keep dreaming if you think you’re good.
|CN?|, that changes nothing.
Finally, |CN?|, you did something.
Wow, you didn’t die, |CN?|.
|CN?|, a rare moment of usefulness.
|CN?|, you still suck.
|CN?|, you got lucky.
Even a noob gets a kill, |CN?|.
A kill, but you’re still trash, |CN?|.
