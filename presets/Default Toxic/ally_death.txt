Wow, |CN|, even bots are better than you.
How many times do you plan on dying like that, |CN|?
Seriously, |CN|? Are you even trying?
|CN|, you're a walking disaster.
Watching you play hurts my soul, |CN|.
|CN|, uninstall and do us all a favor.
Another pointless death, |CN|. Shocking.
Pathetic, |CN|. Just pathetic.
|CN|, you must be the reason we're losing.
Great job feeding, |CN|.
|CN|, you're a disgrace to this team.
Could you be any worse, |CN|?
Every time you die, I lose more hope.
|CN|, even minions have more sense.
Do you even know what you're doing, |CN|?
|CN|, just stop playing. Please.
Another useless death, thanks |CN|.
|CN|, you make me regret playing this game.
Are you blind, |CN|?
|CN|, you're dragging us all down.
|CN|, it's painful to watch you play.
We'd be better off without you, |CN|.
|CN|, how are you so bad at this?
Another death, another disappointment, |CN|.
|CN|, why are you even here?
|CN|, your performance is depressing.
Just quit, |CN|. You're hopeless.
|CN|, you make losing look easy.
|CN|, I didn't think it was possible to be this bad.
|CN|, you're ruining the game for everyone.
That death was so avoidable, |CN|.
|CN|, it's like you're trying to lose.
|CN|, you should feel ashamed.
Thanks for nothing, |CN|.
|CN|, every death is a new low.
|CN|, you're a liability.
|CN|, you're the worst player I've seen.
|CN|, your gameplay is tragic.
|CN|, it's like you're not even trying.
Another dumb death, |CN|. Impressive.
|CN|, do you even care?
|CN|, you should stop playing altogether.
|CN|, you just keep getting worse.
|CN|, every death is more pointless than the last.
|CN|, it's honestly sad watching you.
|CN|, you're making this game unbearable.
You should just AFK, |CN|.
|CN|, you're beyond help.
|CN|, why do you bother playing?
